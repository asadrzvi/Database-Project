				Our team designed this website to meet the specifications assigned by Uma Ramamurthy for our database project. Our database provides a list of songs provided from numerous sources that we do not own for testing purposes. Anybody with a UHID can use our service to listen to music. In order to be an artist, you must upload at least one track, along with adding additional information.
